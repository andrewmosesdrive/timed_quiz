# Homework 4 Assignment
## Timed Quiz with localStorage

For this assignment, I was tasked with creating a timed quiz local storage capabilities, utilizing JavaScript, HTML, and CSS with the following acceptance criteria:

-GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
-WHEN I click the start button
-THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
-WHEN I answer a question
-THEN I am presented with another question
-WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
-THEN time is subtracted from the clock
-WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
-THEN the game is over
-WHEN the game is over
-THEN I can save my initials and score

This assignment was completed from the ground up with no structure or pre-existing code available. I approached this assignment by building out what i needed, piece by piece, as opposed to trying to tackle large portions at a time. I believe this was immensely helpful, and not only kept my workflow fluid, but helped my build out my pseudocode and debug as I went.

### Credits
- Joey Jepson (@alligatormonday) assissted me with minor fixes, and we accomplished building out our local storage functions together
- Dane Burns (@daneburns) for guidance on integration and properly utilizing the local storage function
- Jeremy Cantwell (tutor) for pointing me in the right direction after some struggles with integrating the timer function
- @florinpop17 was referenced for good examples
- https://www.sitepoint.com/simple-javascript-quiz/ was referenced for good examples
- w3schools and MDN for general resource guides

### Summarized Methodology/Structuring
- Build out quiz structure/functionality
- Build out timer structure/functionaly
- Integrate the two and debug
- Create separate HTML and JS pages for utilizing the localStorage
(see extensive pseudocoding for a more step-by-step look)

### Outiside features utilized
- For this assignment, i utilized the "template literal" (AKA "string literal") in multiple sections of my code. This was immensely helpful and a very unique tool which simplified pulling certain values and changing text content without relying too heavily on the HTML. It was especially helpful since we were not using jQuery in this.
